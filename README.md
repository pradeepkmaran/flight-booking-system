# flight-booking-system   

This is a flight booking system that runs on Python in the terminal. It allows users to book flights from a given list of available flights. The system stores flight details such as source, destination, available seats, departure time, cost, and refund percentage in a dictionary. Users can book tickets, calculate the total cost, collect payment, handle insufficient transactions, return balance, and check seat availability. The system also collects passenger information including name, age, and phone number.

  Users can book tickets by selecting a flight from the available flights list. The system checks the availability of seats on the selected flight and prompts the user if the flight is already fully booked.
